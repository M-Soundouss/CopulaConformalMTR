# Copula Conformal Multi Target Regression

Code for article : Copula-based conformal prediction for Multi-Target Regression

Environment : Python 3.6 with Keras, Tensorflow, and libraries numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, copulae.

Note : The representations are not deterministic, so it may not have the same results as in the paper,
but the idea and the tendencies remain the same.
